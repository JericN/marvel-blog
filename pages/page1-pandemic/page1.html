						<p>COVID virus hits Earth!</p>
						<p>The global pandemic is a battle that every single soul on Earth is affected. This battle like those in Marvel films requires heroes, real-life heroes not in spandex and cape but in PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) and face mask. They are the ones who battles and faces the virus on a daily basis and leaves their families at home to fight the unseen enemy.</br><br> The battle against COVID-19 reminds me of the battle in Avengers: Age of Ultron. The battle made a great deal of destruction in the Eastern European country of Sokovia, and ended with a lot of casualties but the world was saved and was able to move forward after the event. This is how I forsee the world after this pandemic. Sometimes these films are not just action-packed but it helps you have a steady and positive perspective amidst all the negativities.</p>

					<p>The New Normal</p>
					<p>The world has changed. It will take time, maybe years, before we get back to our old routines and lifestyle. But let this moment be a reminder to each and everyone that Health is Wealth, regardless of how cliche or platitude it may seem. But without good health, you won't be able to achieve all the great stuffs in life. With poor health, everything will be restricted.</br>Today, we live in a world where face mask, face shield and alcohol (not the drinkable ones) are part of our daily life. This is temporary, it won't be easy, but it won't take hundred years to win over COVID-19. As the great men says, "Whatever it takes" we will win this together!</p>

						<p>There was obviously no way the two Marvel stars were going to let one hospital miss out, so Evans duly dusted off his Captain America outfit to visit Seattle Children’s Hospital at the weekend. Chris Pratt tagged along and together the pair visited patients at the hospital, posing for photos and dishing out merchandise.</p>

I'm an ambassador for , having traveled to Sri Lanka and India to visit sustainable living programs, women's support groups and Oxfam supported schools in both rural and metropolitan communities.
