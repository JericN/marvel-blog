					<div><p>The suit has an internal onboard computer operating system with installed artificial intelligence that aids in providing strategies, background information on opponents, internal guidance, status of the suit and other highly advance programs.</p></div>
					<div><p>The armor is powered by a combination of solar converters, electrical batteries and an on-board generator that uses beta particle absorption as a fuel source and a miniature arc reactor Capable of generating 8 GJ/s.</p></div>
					<div><p>Equiped with a powerful searchlight, capable of projecting beams in virtually every light spectrum, Smart Missiles, extremely powerful plasma discharges that propagate in strength over distance.</p></div>
					<div><p>Suit's microscopic scale chain mail is made rigid by numerous computer-controlled magnetic beam generators. These generators can sense and amplify the suit wearer's motions and strength and capable of unleashing electromagnetic force field</p></div>
					<div><p>Entire armor also generates anti-gravity force field, turbine in boots and backpack provide thrust, Each boot is equipped with small cryogenic storage tank containing liquid air which are able to fuel the mini-turbines is non-atmospheric environments.</p></div>

					<p>Yesterday, the year when the oldest person on earth was born. All the technologies that we are currently experiencing were merely wishful thinking, or maybe perceived as crazy idea or only miracle from the skies. Who would have thought that today, body parts can be replaced or supported by artificial technology, and that internet can connect people from different sides of the world real-time. Some of these technologies were shown countless times in cinemas before it became a fact in reality. Marvel films introduced me to the wonders of technology, they inspire me to be significant in this arena. </p>

					<p>Elon Musk and other big companies can now be considered as another stark industry. With projects like the SpaceX, neuralink, quantum  computing, we will be able to explore uncharted areas of the galaxy and push the technology to greather heights. This made me realize of the unimaginable ideas, no one will know maybe in the next decade the moon is just a 10 hrs ride from Earth, and selfie pictures at the moon's crater is just an ordinary image on social medias. </p>

				<p>  The blueprint of technology is a tricky path to decipher. Those we initially thought that were impossible are now facts, and some are actually, part of our daily lives such as WiFi, internet, smart phones, A.Is etc. There's a little chance that only few people (or maybe none) who doesn't know or experienced the wonders of technology.</p>
				<p>My take on this is that we need to continuously challenge the norms, and what seems normal and working. If things are okay, then, it doesn't end there. We are moving forward and only those who fail to prepare will take the back seats, or worst will be left behind.</p>
				<p>Just because something works, doesn’t mean it can’t be improved.</p>
