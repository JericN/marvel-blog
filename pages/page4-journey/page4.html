					<p>A Decade of Unstoppable Progress</p>
					<p>
						The year 2000 was considered a year of metamorphosis. The birth of the new
						generation - a new era. Unbeknown to many, it was also the year I was born
						and the birth of the first remarkable Marvel movie. In the course of the
						last two decades, I grew up watching Marvel films, and blessed enough to
						witness the unmatchable and flawless character development of the on-screen
						heroes whilst I am also taking my journey towards self-discovery and
						development.
						<br /><br />
						I am highly excited to share the highlights of my journey in life and with
						the influence of Marvel - how my thoughts and aspirations were immensely
						affected and how I see the world through these lenses.
						<br /><br />
						Brace yourselves and enjoy the ride!

						<p>
							The Captain America: First Avenger was the first marvel film on the list
							that made a special mark in me. It wasn't the strong physique but the
							inner strength - the morale, the character that really matters. The
							serum may have made Steve Rogers a shape of a superhero but his moral
							compass, his austerity and love for humanity was built long before he
							even became Captain America.
						</p>
						<p>
							Iron man reminds me of myself. Someone who enjoys the science of
							resolving problems and the unending decrypting of the logic that
							surrounds every individual and decisions in this world. He is not
							perfect, but he is not pretending to be one. He fell a thousand times,
							but he stood up a million times. He maybe a fool sometimes, but he is
							not coward.
						</p>
						<p>
							Thor's character development is beyond perfection. He is the god of
							thunder, he is a prince to Asgard (his realm), a son to Odin, a powerful
							God that protects all worlds. He started off as an ambitious prince
							blinded by all the praises and love of his people. He fails to realize
							his entitled behavior and learnt the hard way to regain his worthiness
							to be a king to Asgard, and to lift the mjolnir (his hammer).
						</p>
						<p>
							The first Avengers movie was the culmination of Marvel Cinematic
							Universe (MCU)'s Phase 1. It didn't fail to give you countless
							goosebumps and jaw-dropping scenes from the heroes' first meet -up to
							the attacks in New York and up to the ending credit scene at the
							shawarma stop. Avengers is undeniably the best film that reflects an
							outstanding deal of camaraderie, and the beginning of the new era in the
							movie landscape.
						</p>
						<p>
							Coming from different walks of life (and literally species). The
							Guardians of the Galaxy offers a very unique combination of soon-to-be
							heroes. All of the characters were criminals. The friendship that was
							forged is one of the most powerful relationships in the entirety of MCU.
							The rapport between the characters are too perfect that will make you
							excited to see them mixed up with the Avengers.

					While all of the characters in Marvel are fictional, and too far-fetched from
					reality. For some people, these movies serves as an escape from the harsh
					reality of life, and temporary relief from boredom. But for me these films
					served a different kind of insipration, these are not just films but a symbol of
					hope and courage to face what is happening in the world. The films engraved a
					mark in me that I want to be successful like them. It maybe totally different
					from what is seen on screen, but it resembles the same feeling when you are
					vying to achieve something in life.

					Whatever happens tomorrow, you must promise me one thing. That you will stay who
					you are, not a perfect soldier, but a good man. - Dr. Abraham Erskine
