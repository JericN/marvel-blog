						"I'm not looking for forgiveness. And I'm way past asking permission. Earth
						just lost her best defender. So we're here to fight. And if you wanna stand
						in our way... we'll fight you, too." <br />
						<br />Considered by many as the world's first and greatest superhero, Steve
						Rogers has been defined by his courage, patriotism, and righteousness.
						Rogers has always had a noble and honest spirit, intolerant towards
						injustice and abuses of power. Since he grew up weak and small, he learned
						on his own that true strength is having the courage to fight against abuse,
						no matter one's power, and having compassion for the innocent.

						"I shouldn't be alive... unless it was for a reason. I'm not crazy, Pepper.
						I just finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it's
						right." <br /><br />Many people in the media thought that Tony Stark was
						only just an egocentric playboy. As an adult, he was renowned for being
						casually arrogant, apathetic, callous, and a hedonist who enjoyed the finer
						things in life, namely drinking, gambling, partying and flirting. However,
						it is shown that Tony did care for people, especially his friends. Although
						Tony causes trouble on occasion, he is more than willing to make up for his
						mistakes, which is also why he became a superhero.

						"I’m only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is just the latest in a
						long line of bastards, and he’ll be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate
						wills it so." <br /><br />Before his banishment to Earth, Thor was initially
						conceited, arrogant, immature and stubborn. He had proven to be bloodthirsty
						and enjoyed the challenge of battle and combat. In his heart, he only wishes
						to live up to the expectations of his father to become a great king but, in
						truth, he did have difficulty finding the difference between a ruler and a
						warrior and what makes each a good man.

						"For all the destruction Hulk has caused over the years, he's done that only
						after we attacked him. In fact, whenever he's seen innocents threatened,
						Hulk has gone out of his way to protect them. Suggests to me that buried
						within that raging monster beats the heart of a hero." <br /><br />Bruce
						Banner is shown as a mild-mannered, mysterious, shy and analytical man of
						science. He is compassionate and afraid of hurting someone unintentionally,
						so he tries not to get close to something or someone that leaves him
						stressed.In turn, Hulk is more primitive with his senses amplified to such
						an extent that it is difficult for his brain to process it all.

						"The truth is a matter of circumstance. It's not all things to all people,
						all the time. Neither am I."<br /><br />She was capable of convincingly
						portraying friendly and flirtatious, timid, vulnerable, and scared. For the
						most part, she was a level-headed, strong-willed, and independent woman.
						Romanoff normally maintained a controlled, almost emotionless persona to
						keep whatever she was thinking a secret unless she was around people she
						absolutely trusts.

						"Okay, look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots... and I
						have a bow and arrow. None of this makes sense. But I'm going back out there
						because it's my job."<br /><br />Clint Barton is dedicated to his job of
						protecting the innocent. Barton had made himself one of their best soldiers,
						tacticians, and marksmen, and had shown great loyalty and dedication to
						whatever his objective is, and always gets the mission done, as he will
						fight until the end and then keep fighting. However, despite this
						commitment, he disobeying orders in order to do what he believes is right as
						well as seeing through whatever he does his own way.

					A hero, by definition, is someone who is admired for his or her courage,
					nobility and exemplary achievements. This person does not need to have
					superpowers to be a hero. Most real-life heroes are ordinary citizens who act
					courageously in difficult or dangerous situations in order to save someone from
					tragic outcomes. A hero can also be a teacher, a parent or an ordinary
					student.<br /><br />
					Anyone can be a hero, anyone can save someone whenever a situation calls for it.
					it. But not everyone is brave enough to be one. The world needs more modern
					heroes, not those who are willing to sacrifice their life, but those who are
					willing to change the world for a better one.<br /><br />
