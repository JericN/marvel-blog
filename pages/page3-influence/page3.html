                <p class="pcontent">It may sound insignificant to others, but my early life surrounds around Marvel. I watched cartoons and animes as a kid and enjoyed role playing with other kids my age and I always play as Iron man. It was at first an unconsious impact, I wasn't aware until 2018 that Marvel have greatly affected me up into the core.</br></br>It's not addiction, I'm not addicted to Marvel, don't get me wrong. There's a difference between addiction and inspiration. I'm not inspired to be a superhero or to gain superpowers. The kind of inspiration I get from Marvel is on how far can I go in my life. How can I be significant in the chosen field or career that I will pursue in the future.</p>

                <p class="pcontent">Marvel has set the bar high for sci-fi and action films. They used state of the art visual effects, effective casting and director, and not to mention, the outstanding continuity of storyline for all 20 Marvel films. I also think, other superhero films like DC's. Will be having a hard time to catch up with Marvel unless they pursue doing stand-alone films for their villains like Joker.</br><br> A bold, ambitious undertaking, the MCU has given rise to imitators but none have matched the original’s scope or consistency. It may be a cultural behemoth but the likes of Inception, The Artist, Boyhood, Moonlight, La La Land and The Shape of Water, to name just a few, prove that brilliant films of all shapes and sizes have thrived alongside it.</p>

                <p class="ptitle">“Do you think Marvel will run for another decade?</p>
                <p class="pcontent">Yes. Absolutely, there are hundreds of marvel characters that are yet to be explored and I heard there will be a revamp of X-MEN which is highly anticipated by all Marvel fans from all corners of the world. There's also a lot of plans for Movies and TV series for the next phase of MCU such as Black Widow, The Eternals, Falcon and Wintersolider, What Ifs, WandaVision and Loki.</br></br>Movie trends come and go, It might take another 2 or 3 more decades to show all the amazing characters of Marvel, but certainly for the foreseeable future the Marvel Cinematic Universe is here to stay. And maybe for even longer than the western.</p>

                <p>A Story of a Lifetime</p>
                <p>Marvel Studios has brought wit, charm, heart, color into our lives when the world around us seems so bleak at times. It gives us all an outlet, heroes to look up to and to see ourselves in, that’s what’s most important. Anything from showing a kid he can build himself up to become greater, or giving young colored minorities heroes to cheer on that look, and feel like us, to providing young girls heroes to stand up and say yes you can fight to. The MCU will always be there, and be keep on breaking barriers and uniting people, with new stories, adaptations; films and TV alike. Because that’s what Heroes do <br><br> As Ant-man said “It’s not about saving our world. It’s about saving theirs.” </p>
